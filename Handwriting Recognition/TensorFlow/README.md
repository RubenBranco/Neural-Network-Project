# nn-project

A repository that contains my efforts in learning how Neural Networks work. Their different architectures, activation functions,
learning methods and the different tasks that can be achieved with one. The first ones will be done from scratch(other than the use
of numpy of course), further ones will be used using a framework.

All of this is done in Python 3.6.
